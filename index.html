<div class="cols1">
<section>
<p class="pfloat">
this is a small amount of text that I am making
    longer by adding some text
    directly in the github page
to create the first column using float:left
but i still have to create several more columns
to see that it actually works
</p>
</div>
<div class="cols2">
<p class="pfloat">
so this is the second column but I have to
    a larger margin both to the left and right
    otherwise the text looks cramped so
    i will do just that now
</p>
</div>

<p class="pfloat">
but even better would be to put a thin line
between each of the columns so it is extra
clear that these are several disticnt columns
